    <label>sorne pherocore</label>
    <description>A pheromone controlling micro-organ. It is necessary to construct certain types of insectoid hives. Pherocores have been embedded deep into the brains of geneline leaders which allowed ancient civilizations to control the hives.\n\nThis pherocore belongs to the oldest geneline from the planet Sorne, which is known for their great numbers and versatility.</description>
