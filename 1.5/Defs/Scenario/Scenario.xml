		<description>The four of you, armed to the teeth, drop on an emerging insectoid nest. Eliminating this bug menace will be imperative to secure the local area.</description>
		<scenario>
			<name>Mercenaries</name>
			<summary>A group of mercenaries, diving into an insectoid menace. A classic VFE - Insectoids 2 experience.</summary>
			<description>Hired by an urbworld magnate with a thirst for thrilling holovid content, your mission was as perilous as it was lucrative. Armed to the teeth, your squad plunges from orbit in experimental hellpods, targeting a land swarming with deadly insectoids. The promise of a hefty payday made the risk worthwhile - until you discovered the magnate's treacherous plan to stiff you.\nAs the hellpods streak towards the surface, your trajectory locks onto a semi-developed insectoid hive colony. Expect fierce resistance, but if you triumph, the area teems with resources ripe for establishing a base - either a temporary haven or a long-term stronghold.\nYou’re aware that survival isn’t guaranteed for all, but with the element of surprise on your side, the odds tilt ever so slightly in your favor.\n\nNote: Since you start inside an insectoid megahive, this is a difficult scenario.
